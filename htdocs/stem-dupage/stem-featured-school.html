  <strong>STEM at Lakeview Junior High...&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="featSchP"><img src="../images/featured-school/lakeview-jr-high/featured01.jpg" class="featSchImg" /><br>Esther, an 8th grader, has had 3 years of STEM lab experience and likes the reinforcement of concepts in two different classes. Esther says, "I find it really nice—STEM lab helps you within your math class doing the same things—the teachers talk as a team—we’re doing slope in math class and slope in STEM. Two different teachers teaching it two different ways, so you get two different perspectives for learning."</p>
<p class="featSchP"><img src="../images/featured-school/lakeview-jr-high/featured02.jpg" class="featSchImg" /><br>Amogh is making a model of a phone on the 3D printer in the STEM Lab.  He explains that the printer allows people with limited resources to have opportunities for designing and prototyping. About His plans for the future, Amogh says, “I want to go to MIT or Stanford and be the CEO of Apple when I grow up.” </p>
<p class="featSchP"><img src="../images/featured-school/lakeview-jr-high/featured03.jpg" class="featSchImg" /><br>Teacher Erika Myers says, "Within this technological world, it is essential for our students to develop skills which will allow them to collaborate, problem solve and innovate. STEM education gives students the opportunity to develop these skills while fueling an interest in math and science."</p>
